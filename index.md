## Getting Started

Getting started with Frankie is super-simple, you can create the base project (or use [the standard application](standard-app))
using composer:

```sh
$ composer create-project wdalmut/frankie-tiny-app:dev-master myapp
$ cd myapp
```

Now just bring up your dev server:

```sh
$ php -S localhost:8080 -t web
```

And navigate to: ["http://localhost:8080/"](http://localhost:8080)
